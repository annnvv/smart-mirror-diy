# Smart Mirror DIY

**Status**: IN PROGRESS

**Purpose**: The purpose of this repo is to house the code to generate an interface for a smart mirror.

The code in this repo is based on this repo [https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Mirror]

The smart mirror will display:
- [DONE] Greeting
- Day of Week, Date
- Time of day
- [IN PROGRESS] Weather information (temperature and current weather icon)
- [IN PROGRESS] WMATA next train information
- [ON HOLD] DASH bus information


**Lessons Learned**:
- Creating a GUI using tkinter
- Python Object Orientation
  - instance versus class methods
  - inheritance of classes
- Calling REST APIs using requests
